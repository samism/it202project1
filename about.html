<h1>Data</h1>
<p>Used the spotify and google map apis. User enters a musician's name and a GET request is done with jQuery to spotify's endpoint to first obtain the artistId
   and this is then used to make a second GET request to obtain this artist's top songs. Upon clicking a song, spotify's listed available markets are used against 
   Google's geocoder service to obtain a latitude and longitude. This is then used to place markers to indicate on a google map, what geolocations this artist is popular in.
</p>

<h1>Framework</h1>
<p>Used jQuery, bootstrap, spotify's api, and google's map and geocoder apis.</p>

<h1>Process</h1>
<p>The hardest part was figuring how to work with asynchronous calls to apis. I had to understand how promises and deferred objects
   are used in javascript. This was the most challenging aspect. The other challenges included traversing the JSON received by the
   apis with jQuery and making sure user input, asynchonorous ajax, and the visual presentation was working. This project took me
   a week longer than the scheduled due date because the promise frameworks in javascript were hard to figure out.
